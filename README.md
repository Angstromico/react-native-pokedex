# 📱 React Native Pokédex

A simple Pokédex app built as my first React Native project.
This project is focused on learning the fundamentals of React Native, Expo, components, navigation, and working with APIs.

---

## 🚀 About the Project

This app displays a list of Pokémon and lets the user explore basic information such as name, image, and type.
It is intentionally simple so the focus stays on understanding how React Native works.

## 🧠 What I Learned

* How to set up a React Native project with Expo
* Creating and styling components
* Using React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
* Fetching data from an API
* Handling loading states and errors
* Basic navigation between screens
* Displaying images and lists in React Native

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React Native**
* **Expo**
* **React Navigation** (optional, if used)
* **PokéAPI** for Pokémon data

3. Start the development server:

4. Open the app:
